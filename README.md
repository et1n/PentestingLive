# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

  - [X] Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection in https://146.148.90.52/blue/public/staff/salespeople/show.php?id=' gives Database query failed, therefore is vulnerable.

  - [X] Bonus Objective #1: Found all three databases globitek_blue/green/red. Able to retrieve all tables/columns with sqlmap and do all the things. Passwords looks like blowfish encrypted.

  - [X] Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation able to use target's sessionId or give a sessionId to target to log in for you.


## Green

  - [X] Vulnerability #1: The feedback section is vulnerable for XSS attacks.

  - [X] Vulnerability #2: Shows if the username exists in the database or not. Log in was unsuccessful is bolded if username exists.


## Red

  - [X] Vulnerability #1: CSRF because you are able to change user info without a token

  - [X] Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation able to use target's sessionId or give a sessionId to target to log in for you.

## Notes

Took some time to get this done with all the exploring and research, but it was fun and interesting! I haven't found an IDOR though. :(
